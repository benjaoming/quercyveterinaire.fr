## My vision

My veterinary practice revolves around responsibility, honesty and presence – values ​​and benchmarks important to me in my work as a veterinarian. Kindness and compassion towards you and your animal as well as respect for the animal is egally important, and an evidence for me as a vet.

My vision is to create a veterinary practice where there is time to care for the animal with respect and on their terms. I would like to offer a veterinary consultation with 100% attention to the animal and you. This requires time and calm. In your home I don't have other patients waiting for me on the other side of the door, nor colleagues asking for attention.

When I step into you home I take all my knowledge and experience as a vet with me to offer high quality medical care to your animal.

My vision is also to create a local veterinary practice, close to you, where the contact with the animal owner is simple and direct and where you feel listened to. When you call Quercy Veterinaire I answer the phone myself, it's me showing up at you house, and when you have a question afterwards, or you animal needs follow up, it's me again. I hope this can create trust between the owner, the animal and me as a vet.
