## My vision

My veterinary practice revolves around key values and benchmarks that I aim to uphold in my work, including: responsibility, honesty and presence. Kindness and compassion towards you, and of course your pet, are equally important to me and a requisite in my work as a veterinarian.

My vision is to create a veterinary practice where enough time is dedicated to care for your animal with respect and on their terms. I offer veterinary consultations where you and your pet receive 100% of my attention. This requires time and calm. In your home, I won't have other patients in the waiting room on the other side of the door, nor a team of colleagues to accommodate.

When I step into your home, I bring all my knowledge and previous experience as a vet with me, to offer high quality medical care to your animal.

I also wish to provide a familiar veterinary service, embedded within our local community and in close proximity to you, where the contact between myself and the pet owner is simple and direct. Building a rapport with my patients and clients is crucial; it is important to me that you feel listened to, and that you feel like you know your vet, and your vet knows you and your animal. When you call Quercy Vétérinaire, I answer the phone myself, it's me showing up at your house, and if you have questions afterwards, or your animal needs a follow-up appointment, it will be me again. I hope this can create trust between the owner, the animal, and me as a vet.
