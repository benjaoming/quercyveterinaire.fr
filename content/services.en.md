## Small animals

A lot of veterinary examinations and treatments can be done at home. I can help with the most common health issues dogs and cats encounter, as well as other services you may need as a pet owner. The following list is not exhaustive, so do not hesitate to call me on 06 98 52 50 19 if you have any questions.

* General health check
* Vaccination
* Identification
* Issuing passports and documents for international travel
* Small wounds and injuries
* Lameness
* Chronical pain
* Ear infections
* Skin problems
* Eye problems
* Gastrointestinal upsets
* Blood tests and other non-urgent sample taking
* Sedation for cutting nails, shaving etc

### Referrals to a clinic

Certain types of examinations or treatments require a lot of specialist equipment and personnel. In these cases, I will refer you safely and responsibly - either straightaway over the telephone, or after an initial examination of your animal at home - to a nearby veterinary clinic that will be able to take care of your animal in the best way possible. I have good collaborative relationships with the vet clinics in Parisot, Cahors and Villefranche-de-Rouergue, where you will find colleagues of mine who are highly competent and skilled in areas such as intensive care, x-rays, ultrasound, dental care and surgery.

Blood, skin or other samples that are non-urgent can be taken during the home visit. Some samples are treated on site, some will be examined under the microscope in my small laboratory at the end of the day, and I aim to give you the results as quickly as possible. Some samples are sent to a referral laboratory and it may be a few days before you receive your results. As soon as I have the results, I will inform you. 

### Euthanasia 

Saying goodbye to your beloved companion is not easy and many owners prefer to say goodbye at home. Home is where your pet feels most reassured, and the place where he or she can go to sleep peacefully, in familiar and intimate surroundings, with the support of their loved ones. It also grants you, as the owner, a calm and gentle atmosphere, where you can feel as comfortable as possible without having to pay attention to anything other than saying goodbye.
