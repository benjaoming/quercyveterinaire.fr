A lot of veterinaire exams and treatment can be done at home. I help with the most common health issues dogs and cats encounter, as well as the services you need as a pet owner. The following list is not exhaustive, do not hesitate to contact me at 06 98 52 50 19 if you have any questions.

* General health check

### Referral

Certain types of examinations or treatments require a lot of equipment and personnel. In these cases, I will refer you safely, either directly over the telephone or after seeing your animal at home, to a nearby veterinary clinic that can take care of your animal in the best possible way. I have a good collaboration with the vet clinics in Parisot, Cahors and Villefranche de Rouergue where you will find competent colleagues for intensive care, x-rays, ultrasound, dental care and surgery.

### Samples

Blood, skin or other samples that are non urgent can be taken during the home visit. Some samples are treated on site, some will be examined under the microscope in my small laboratory at the end of the day, and I will give you the results as quickly as possible. Some samples are sent to a referral laboratory and the results may take some days. As soon as I have the results I will inform you.

### Euthanasia

Saying goodbye to your companion is not easy and many owners want to say goodbye at home. Home is the place where your pet feels most reassured, and the place where she or he can fall asleep calmly with everything familiar around them. It also provides you, as the owner, a calm  atmosphere, where you don't have to devote your attention to anything else  than saying goodbye.
