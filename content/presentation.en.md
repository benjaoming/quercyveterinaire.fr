## Who am I?

My name is Yrja, I have been living in Concots in the Lot since 2017 with my husband and our children on a sheep farm. Originally from Norway, I graduated as a vet from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark in 2016. During my studies I also took courses in France at the ONIRIS veterinary school in Nantes and in Oslo, Norway. Since leaving school I have worked with pets, sports and farm animals in different veterinary practices first in Norway, then in Sweden and France where I 'exercise now.
