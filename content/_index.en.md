## Veterinary consultations at home... Why?

For some animals, travelling to, or visiting the veterinary clinic can be stressful or cause fear, particularly if the animal is feeling unwell. Perhaps you know of a dog who already shows signs of stress in the vet's car park? Or have you ever had a hard time getting your cat into its carrier? For a number of reasons, a visit to the vet can be a distressing experience for your animal, as well as for you. 'At home' consultations are an alternative option, allowing you to receive the veterinary care you need, in the familiarity and comfort of your own home, a reassuring environment for your pet.
