## Why a veterinay consultation at home?

For some animals, traveling to or visiting the veterinary clinic can be stressful or cause fear. Perhaps you know a dog showing signs of stress alreadu at the vets parking lot? Or have you ever had a hard time getting your cat into a transport cage? A visit to the veterinarian can be a stressful experience for the animal and  its owner for different reasons. Home consultations is an alternative for you who would like veterinary care in the familiar and reassuring environment of your home.
